# Quick Start

Run a new database container (data is removed when the container is removed, but kept throughout container restarts):

```shell
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> gvenzl/oracle-free
```

Run a new persistent database container (data is kept throughout container lifecycles):

```shell
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> -v oracle-volume:/opt/oracle/oradata gvenzl/oracle-free
```

Reset database `SYS` and `SYSTEM` passwords:

```shell
docker exec <container name|id> resetPassword <your password>
```

## Oracle Database Free on Apple M chips
Currently, there is no Oracle Database port for ARM chips, hence Oracle Database Free images cannot run on the new Apple M chips via Docker Desktop.  
Fortunately, there are other technologies that can spin up `x86_64` software on Apple M chips, such as [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima). To run these Oracle Database Free images on Apple M hardware, follow these simple steps:

* Install colima ([instructions](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima#installation))
* Run `colima start --arch x86_64 --memory 4`
* Start container as usual

# How to use this image

## Environment variables

Environment variables allow you to customize your container. Note that these variables will only be considered during the database initialization (first container startup).

### `ORACLE_PASSWORD`
This variable is mandatory for the first container startup and specifies the password for the Oracle Database `SYS` and `SYSTEM` users.

### `ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty value, like `yes`, to generate a random initial password for the `SYS` and `SYSTEM` users. The generated password will be printed to stdout (`ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM: ...`).

### `ORACLE_DATABASE`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new pluggable database with the name specified in this variable.  
**Note:** creating a new database will add to the initial container startup time. If you do not want that additional startup time, use the already existing `XEPDB1` database instead.

### `APP_USER`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new database schema user with the name specified in this variable. For 18c and onwards, the user will be created in the default `XEPDB1` pluggable database. If `ORACLE_DATABASE` has been specified, the user will also be created in that pluggable database. This variable requires `APP_USER_PASSWORD` or `APP_USER_PASSWORD_FILE` to be specified as well.

### `APP_USER_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to define a password for the database schema user specified by `APP_USER`. This variable requires `APP_USER` to be specified as well.

## GitHub Actions
The images can be used as a [Service Container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-service-containers) within a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow. Below is an example service definition for your GitHub Actions YAML file:

```yaml
    services:

      # Oracle service (label used to access the service container)
      oracle:

        # Docker Hub image (feel free to change the tag "latest" to any other available one)
        image: gvenzl/oracle-free:latest

        # Provide passwords and other environment variables to container
        env:
          ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD: true
          APP_USER: my_user
          APP_USER_PASSWORD: password_i_should_change

        # Forward Oracle port
        ports:
          - 1521:1521

        # Provide healthcheck script options for startup
        options: >-
          --health-cmd healthcheck.sh
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 10
```

After your service is created, you can connect to it via the following properties:

* Hostname:
  * `oracle` (from within another container)
  * `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (from the host directly)
* Port: `1521`
* Service name: `XEPDB1`
* Database App User: `my_user`
* Database App Password: `password_i_should_change`

If you amend the variables above, here is some more useful info:

* Ports: you can access the port dynamically via `${{ job.services.oracle.ports[1521] }}`. This is helpful when you do not want to specify a given port via `- 1521/tcp` instead of `- 1521:1521`.  Note that the `oracle` refers to the service name in the yaml file. If you call your service differently, you will also have to change `oracle` here to that other service name.
* Database Admin User: `system`
* Database Admin User Password: `$ORACLE_PASSWORD`
* Database App User: `$APP_USER`
* Database App User Password: `$APP_USER_PASSWORD`
* Example JDBC connect string with dynamic port allocation: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:${{ job.services.oracle.ports[1521] }}/XEPDB1`

# Image flavors

| Flavor  | Extension | Description                                                                                 | Use cases                                                                                              |
| --------| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slim      | `-slim`       | An image focussed on smallest possible image size instead of additional functionality.      | Wherever small image sizes are important but advanced functionality of Oracle Database is not needed. |
| Regular   | [None]        | A well-balanced image between image size and functionality. Recommended for most use cases. | Recommended for most use cases.                                                                        |
| Full      | `-full`       | An image containing all functionality as provided by the Oracle Database installation.      | Best for extensions and/or customizations.                                                             |
| Faststart | `*-faststart` | The same image flavor as above but with an already expanded and ready-to-go database inside the image. This image trades image size on disk for a faster database startup time. | Best for (automated) test scenarios where the image is pulled once and many containers are started and torn down with no need for persistence (container volumes). |

For a full list of changes that have been made to the Oracle Database and OS installation in each individual image flavor, please see [ImageDetails.md](https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-free/blob/main/ImageDetails.md).

## Database users

The image provides a built-in command `createAppUser` to create additional Oracle Database users with standard privileges. The same command is also executed when the `APP_USER` environment variable is specified. If you need just one additional database user for your application, the `APP_USER` environment variable is the best approach. However, if you need multiple users, you can execute the command for each individual user directly:

```shell
Usage:
  createAppUser APP_USER APP_USER_PASSWORD [TARGET_PDB]

  APP_USER:          the user name of the new user
  APP_USER_PASSWORD: the password for that user
  TARGET_PDB:        the target pluggable database the user should be created in, default XEPDB1
```

Example:

```shell
docker exec <container name|id> createAppUser <your app user> <your app user password> [<your target PDB>]
```

The command can also be invoked inside initialization and/or startup scripts.

## Container secrets

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to some of the previously listed environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Container/Docker secrets stored in `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` files. For example:

```shell
docker run -d --name some-oracle -e ORACLE_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/oracle-passwd gvenzl/oracle-free
```

This mechanism is supported for:

* `APP_USER_PASSWORD`
* `ORACLE_PASSWORD`
* `ORACLE_DATABASE`

**Note**: there is a significant difference in how containerization technologies handle secrets. For more information on that topic, please consult the official containerization technology documentation:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)
* [Podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/new-podman-secrets-command)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)

## Initialization scripts
If you would like to perform additional initialization of the database running in a container, you can add one or more `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz`, `*.sql.zip` or `*.sh` files under `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` (creating the directory if necessary). After the database setup is completed, these files will be executed automatically in alphabetical order.

The directory can include sub-directories which will be traversed recursively in alphabetical order alongside the files. The container does not give any priority to files or directories, meaning that whatever comes next in alphabetical order will be processed next. If it is a file it will be executed, if it is a directory it will be traversed. To guarantee the order of execution, consider using a clear prefix in your file and directory names like numbers `001_`, `002_`. This will also make it easier for any user to understand which script is supposed to be executed in what order.

The `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz` and `*.sql.zip` files ***will be executed in SQL\*Plus as the `SYS` user connected to the Oracle instance (`XE`).*** This allows users to modify instance parameters, create new pluggable databases, tablespaces, users and more as part of their initialization scripts. ***If you want to initialize your application schema, you first have to connect to that schema inside your initialization script!*** Compressed files will be uncompressed on the fly, allowing for e.g. bigger data loading scripts to save space.

Executable `*.sh` files will be run in a new shell process while non-executable `*.sh` files (files that do not have the Linux e`x`ecutable permission set) will be sourced into the current shell process. The main difference between these methods is that sourced shell scripts can influence the environment of the current process and should generally be avoided. However, sourcing scripts allows for execution of these scripts even if the executable flag is not set for the files containing them. This basically avoids the "why did my script not get executed" confusion.

***Note:*** scripts in `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` are only run the first time the database is initialized; any pre-existing database will be left untouched on container startup.

***Note:*** you can also put files under the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory. This is kept for backward compatibility with other widely used container images but should generally be avoided. Do not put files under `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` **and** `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` as this would cause the same files to be executed twice!

***Warning:*** if a command within the sourced `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts fails, it will cause the main entrypoint script to exit and stop the container. It also may leave the database in an incomplete initialized state. Make sure that shell scripts handle error situations gracefully and ideally do not source them!

***Warning:*** do not exit executable `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts with a non-zero value (using e.g. `exit 1;`) unless it is desired for a container to be stopped! A non-zero return value will tell the main entrypoint script that something has gone wrong and that the container should be stopped.

### Example

The following example installs the [countries, cities and currencies sample data set](https://github.com/gvenzl/sample-data/tree/master/countries-cities-currencies) under a new user `TEST` into the database:

```shell
[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ pwd
/home/gvenzl/init_scripts

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxr-x   2 gvenzl gvenzl   61 Apr  3 20:11 .
drwx------. 19 gvenzl gvenzl 4096 Apr  3 20:11 ..
-rw-rw-r--   1 gvenzl gvenzl  134 Apr  3 20:10 1_create_user.sql
-rwxrwxr-x   1 gvenzl gvenzl  164 Apr  3 20:11 2_create_data_model.sh

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ cat 1_create_user.sql
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=XEPDB1;

CREATE USER TEST IDENTIFIED BY test QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO TEST;

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ cat 2_create_data_model.sh
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvenzl/sample-data/master/countries-cities-currencies/install.sql

sqlplus -s test/test@//localhost/XEPDB1 @install.sql

rm install.sql

```

As the execution happens in alphabetical order, numbering the files will guarantee the execution order. A new container started up with `/home/gvenzl/init_scripts` pointing to `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` will then execute the files above:

```shell
docker run --name test \
>          -p 1521:1521 \
>          -e ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD="y" \
>          -v /home/gvenzl/init_scripts:/container-entrypoint-initdb.d \
>      gvenzl/oracle-free:23-slim

```

## Startup scripts

If you would like to perform additional action after the database running in a container has been started, you can add one or more `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz`, `*.sql.zip` or `*.sh` files under `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` (creating the directory if necessary). After the database is up and ready for requests, these files will be executed automatically in alphabetical order.

The execution order and implications are the same as with the [Initialization scripts](#initialization-scripts) described above.

***Note:*** you can also put files under the `/docker-entrypoint-startdb.d` directory. This is kept for backward compatibility with other widely used container images but should generally be avoided. Do not put files under `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` **and** `/docker-entrypoint-startdb.d` as this would cause the same files to be executed twice!

***Note:*** if the database inside the container is initialized (started for the first time), startup scripts are executed after the setup scripts.

***Warning:*** files placed in `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` are always executed after the database in a container is started, including pre-created databases. Use this mechanism only if you wish to perform a certain task always after the database has been (re)started by the container.
